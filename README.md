# About
This is a full-stack e-commerce project built using Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have created this website for 'Clay and Fire Jewellery', a business that creates handmade pieces of jewellery primarily using Polymer Clay, a lightweight and highly versatile material that is baked to cure it.

# User Experience

# Strategy

This website is for a Business to Consumer (B2C) business that sells handmade polymer clay jewellery. The target market for these products are:

- Women who enjoy fashion and accessorising.
- Those looking for gifts for people who enjoy wearing jewellery.
- Women aged between 15 and 45.

Keeping the above in mind, I believe the Customers will need a website that is:

- Easy to Navigate and filter/search by category.

- Has the ability to view and purchase items.

- Has an email subscription service.

- Has links to Social Media sites Facebook and Instagram.

- User Account functionality, to keep track of order history and store delivery information.

And the Owner will need a website that:

- Appealingly displays their products.

- Allows them to add, edit and remove products. Stock Quantities wasn't a requirement as products are handmade to order and therefore only become unavailable when the seller wishes to stop selling the product.

- Allows customers to get in contact if required whilst having some information readily available to reduce the number of contact forms received.

- Allows user to share feedback on products in order to improve products/service.

# User Stories

# Scope

To achieve the above user and business goals, this project will be created with the following features:

- Site Navigation containing a Search Bar, My Account Links, Shopping Bag links, and Product Categories sections.

- A Landing Page that clearly demonstrates what the site is for.

- A Products Page that lists the Products contained within the category/search carried out.

- Products Cards that gives the user an image of the product along with name, price, and ability to click into it for more details.

- Registration/login functionality using Django AllAuth so that users can create and manage their account.

- A User Profile Page so that users can save delivery details for faster orders in future and to see their order history.

- Custom 404 Error Page
# Structure

This project is structured with a homepage that greets the user with a clear navigation bar at the top of the page to search for the item required or to browse all products. There is the ability to sort items by price, alphabetically, and by category as well as the ability to search for a product by typing keywords into the search bar.

Furthermore, users have the option to checkout as a guest or create a profile for themselves which can contain their delivery address and does contain their order history.

## Wireframes

All wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

Clay & Fire Jewellery Wireframes for Mobile, Tablet and Desktop devices can be viewed [here](assets/documents/wireframes.pdf). I didn't add wireframes for the favourites page as it was based on the same template at the products page. 

# Marketing Strategies

The following questions were asked and answered when trying to decide on the best marketing strategy. 

1.	Which online platforms would you find lots of your users?

- Facebook
- Instagram
- Tiktok
- Etsy

2.	Would your users use social media? If yes, which platforms do you think you would find them on?

- Facebook
- Instagram
- Tiktok

3.	What do your users need? Could you meet that need with useful content? If yes, how could you best deliver that content to them?

- Style Inspiration: 
    - Instagram Posts of our jewellery styled and possible combinations
    - TikTok Videos following current editing trends
- Gift Inspiration
    - Instagram Posts of gift ideas and product combinations
    - Emails with gift ideas, particularly around Christmas or other holidays

4.	Would your business run sales or offer discounts? How do you think your users would most like to hear about these offers?

- Email deals for subscribers
- Sale Emails and Instagram Posts/Stories

5.	What are the goals of your business? Which marketing strategies would offer the best ways to meet those goals?

- Make Sales
- Gather repeat customers

6.	Would your business have a budget to spend on advertising? Or would it need to work with free or low-cost options to market itself?

- Free/low-cost marketing as the budget would need to go towards materials required to create and deliver high-quality products

I also looked at the below business as they both also sell polymer clay jewellery. As you can see from both of these examples their most successful Social Media platform in terms of following is TikTok, followed by Instagram, and lastly Facebook. 

### Shopmalcreates: 
FB Page 535 likes, Instagram 32.7k followers, TikTok 1232 followers

### Indigo Sands: 
FB Page 4037 likes, Instagram 92.4K followers, TikTok 225.7K followers

Although seemingly a successful tool for building a following, as TikTok is a fast-paced video based platform, I have created Instagram and Facebook accounts to act as the Social Media platforms this business uses alongside email marketing. 

### Facebook
